      <h3>Muhammad Aadil Ghani</h3>
      <p> 
        I'm a student at the City Of London University studying, Computer cience with an integrated masters in Cyber Security. I've been introduced to programming a while back as I've taken computer science for both A-Levels and GCSEs. 

        At the start of the first year, I took part in a coding Bootcamp that was designed to give a quick yet detailed explanation of all programming basics, such as Arrays, lists, and loops. This further reinforced my knowledge of these topics and acted as a great refresher just before starting the course.

    <h3>Java game development project </h3>
    <p> 

      My first java game development project is about a game I created called gravity flip. During the development, I gained and solidified my knowledge of Object-oriented programming, which included concepts such as Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymoirish, and Abstraction. Inheritance was used in my project to reduce the amount of repeated code, for example, both of my enemies (Aliens and Alien Bosses)in the game would have the same bullet detection method, which then reduces the amount of unnecessary code required, resulting in a more efficient program. </p>
      
      <p>
      Also, I learned about the use of abstract classes, which have an overall method but can diverge into different objects with their properties. This can be seen in my BackpackItems class, as each weapon will have a operate function, but what/how each weapon will be used is different.
      </p>
       <p>

      The game is about Astrount fighting off Aliens and Alien Bosses in space with a Raygun by its side to eliminate them. The Astronaut also has the help of power-up items, such as Speed up and extra lives interactable to help get to the next level. The movement mechanics for the Astronaut range from the basic left and right movements to the ability to flip gravity so he can run up on the ceiling and flip back down to the floor as he pleases to dodge and eliminate the Aliens and their superiors.
